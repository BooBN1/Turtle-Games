CO2 LSE DA 301 Advanced Analytics for Organisational Impact. Assignment: Predicting future outcomes through the analysis of data sets to help Turtle Games, a games manufacturer and retailer, to improve overall sales performance

Business question 1: How do customers accumulate loyalty points? The 2000 Turtle Games customers have a mean average of 1578 loyalty points. This ranges from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 6847. To explore drivers of loyalty points we have correlated this against customer spend, income and age. Multiple linear regression analysis looking at accumulation of loyalty points shows that 83% of variation can be explained by customer spending and income. In other words, customers will have more loyalty points if they spend more and have higher incomes. Breaking this down using simple linear regression analysis using the OLS method shows the amount spent by customers accounts for 45% of the variation in loyalty points and customer income accounts for a further 38%. Age has minimal impact on how customers accumulate loyalty points.

Business question 2: How can groups within the customer base be used to target specific market segments?

Business question 3: How can social data (e.g. customer reviews) be used to inform marketing campaigns?

Business question 4: What impact does each product have on sales?

Business question 5: How reliable is the data (e.g. normal distribution, skewness or kurtosis)?

Business question 6: What are the relationships, if any, between North American, European and global sales?
