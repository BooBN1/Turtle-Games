CO2 LSE DA 301 Advanced Analytics for Organisational Impact. Assignment: Predicting future outcomes through the analysis of data sets to help Turtle Games, a games manufacturer and retailer, to improve overall sales performance

Business question 1: How do customers accumulate loyalty points? The 2000 Turtle Games customers have a mean average of 1578 loyalty points. This ranges from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 6847. To explore drivers of loyalty points we have correlated this against customer spend, income and age. Multiple linear regression analysis looking at accumulation of loyalty points shows that 83% of variation can be explained by customer spending and income. In other words, customers will have more loyalty points if they spend more and have higher incomes. Breaking this down using simple linear regression analysis using the OLS method shows the amount spent by customers accounts for 45% of the variation in loyalty points and customer income accounts for a further 38%. Age has minimal impact on how customers accumulate loyalty points.

Business question 2: How can groups within the customer base be used to target specific market segments? Using the k=5 model, cluster 1 (middle income/middle spend) has most data points, followed by cluster 0 (high income/high spend) and then cluster 2 (high income/low spend). These three customer segments could be used by the marketing team to target future advertising. A particularly interesting target market could be cluster 2, these customers are high earners but have lower spending scores so the ambition could be to move them into the high income/high spend segment.

Business question 3: How can social data (e.g. customer reviews) be used to inform marketing campaigns? The sentiment analysis of textual social data comments shows a leaning towards positive comments but there is no extreme sentiment in either direction. The most common words left in reviews tend to be positive - as can be seen in the wordcloud visualisation and the plot of the 15 most common words used in customer product reviews. Keywords like ‘five stars’, ‘great’, ‘fun’, ‘love’, ‘good’ feature strongly. Taking a closer look at the top 20 positive reviews and top 20 negative reviews received from customers gives a strong indication of what customers did and didn’t like. A theme coming from the more negative reviews showed that customers found products bought difficult or complicated to use. For example, one dissatisfied customer wrote: “Booo, unless you are patient, know how to measure, I didn’t have the patience neither did my daughter. Boring unless you are a craft person, which i am not”. Conversely, more positive customer experiences revealed much higher satisfaction with the products bought. As one very satisfied customer wrote: “Excellent activity for teaching self-management skills.” As an additional piece of analysis it would be useful for the team to interrogate whether there are any trends in the products bought - so, are some products more likely to elicit negative feedback than others.

Business question 4: What impact does each product have on sales?

Business question 5: How reliable is the data (e.g. normal distribution, skewness or kurtosis)?

Business question 6: What are the relationships, if any, between North American, European and global sales?
